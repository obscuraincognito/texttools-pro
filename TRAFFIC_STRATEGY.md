Title: TextTools Pro — 24 browser-based text and developer tools, no signup, no data collection, 100% client-side

Body:

Hey everyone, sharing my side project that I've been building and refining.

**What it is:** TextTools Pro is a collection of 24 online text manipulation and developer utility tools. Everything runs in the browser. No data leaves your machine.

**Why I built it:** I use a bunch of small online tools throughout my workday — Base64 encoding, JSON formatting, regex testing, timestamp conversion. I kept bouncing between different sites, many of which are ad-heavy or have unclear privacy practices. I wanted one clean place for all of it.

**What's free (13 tools):** Word Counter, Password Generator, Case Converter, Find & Replace, URL Encoder, Base64 Tool, HTML Entities, Hash Generator, Lorem Ipsum Generator, QR Code Generator, UUID Generator, Unix Timestamp Converter, Word Frequency Counter.

**What's premium at $4.99/mo (11 tools):** JSON Formatter, Regex Tester, CSV to JSON, SQL Formatter, Color Converter, Markdown Preview, Text Diff, JWT Decoder, Cron Expression Generator, JSON-YAML Converter, Code Minifier.

Check it out: https://texttools-pro.vercel.app

Would love to hear your thoughts — on the product, the pricing split, the tool selection, anything.

## STEP 4: POST ON r/webdev
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/submit

Title: I built a collection of 24 text and developer tools that run entirely in your browser — no backend, no data collection, no accounts

Body:

Hey r/webdev,

I built TextTools Pro — a set of 24 browser-based tools aimed at the stuff we deal with every day: formatting JSON, testing regex, converting timestamps, generating UUIDs, encoding URLs, diffing text, etc.

The whole thing runs client-side. Nothing gets sent to a server. I built it because I got tired of pasting sensitive data into random online tools and wondering where it ends up.

13 of the tools are completely free:
- Word Counter, Password Generator, Base64 Encoder/Decoder, Hash Generator, QR Code Generator, Unix Timestamp Converter, URL Encoder/Decoder, and more

There are also 11 premium tools behind a $4.99/mo subscription for stuff like JSON Formatter, Regex Tester, CSV-to-JSON, SQL Formatter, Text Diff, JWT Decoder, and Cron Expression Generator.

Link: https://texttools-pro.vercel.app

I'd genuinely appreciate feedback on the UI, the tool selection, anything really. Are there tools you'd want to see added?

## STEP 5: POST ON r/InternetIsBeautiful
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/submit

Title: TextTools Pro — a clean, free collection of browser-based text and developer tools with no signups and no data collection

Body:

https://texttools-pro.vercel.app

24 tools for common text and developer tasks: word counting, password generation, Base64 encoding, JSON formatting, regex testing, QR codes, hash generation, and more.

Everything processes locally in your browser. No accounts, no tracking, no data sent anywhere. 13 tools are free, 11 more are available for $4.99/mo.

## STEP 6: POST ON r/programming
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/submit

Title: 24 developer utility tools that run 100% client-side in the browser — no backend, no data leaves your machine

Body:

I built TextTools Pro to handle the small tasks that break your flow during development: encoding/decoding Base64, formatting JSON or SQL, testing regex patterns, converting between JSON and YAML, decoding JWTs, generating cron expressions, diffing text, minifying code.

The key design decision was making everything client-side. There is no backend processing. When you paste a JWT or a chunk of production JSON, it never touches a server.

**Free (13 tools):** Word Counter, Password Generator, Case Converter, Find & Replace, URL Encoder, Base64, HTML Entities, Hash Generator, Lorem Ipsum, QR Code Generator, UUID Generator, Unix Timestamp Converter, Word Frequency Counter.

**Premium at $4.99/mo (11 tools):** JSON Formatter, Regex Tester, CSV to JSON, SQL Formatter, Color Converter, Markdown Preview, Text Diff, JWT Decoder, Cron Expression Generator, JSON-YAML Converter, Code Minifier.

https://texttools-pro.vercel.app

Open to feedback on the tool selection and the free/paid split.

## STEP 7: POST ON r/Entrepreneur
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/submit

Title: How I'm building a micro-SaaS around something developers already do dozens of times a day

Body:

**The observation:** Developers use small online tools constantly — encoding Base64, formatting JSON, testing regex, converting timestamps. There are hundreds of free options, but most are ad-heavy, have questionable privacy practices, and the experience is fragmented.

**The product:** TextTools Pro (https://texttools-pro.vercel.app) — 24 text and developer tools in one place. Everything runs in the browser. No backend, no data collection, no account required.

**The business model:** 13 tools are free. No catch, no ads, genuinely useful. 11 more developer-focused tools are behind a $4.99/month subscription.

**Why I think this works:**
- The free tier drives organic traffic and builds trust
- The premium tools target developers who use these tools daily
- Zero server costs since everything runs client-side
- The privacy angle is a real differentiator

The hardest part isn't building the tools. It's deciding what's free vs. paid. Too generous and there's no business. Too restrictive and nobody builds the habit.

Would love to hear from anyone who's built in the developer tools space.

URL field: https://texttools-pro.vercel.app

Then IMMEDIATELY go to your post and add this comment:

I built this because I got uncomfortable pasting production data into online tools that send everything to a backend.

TextTools Pro is 24 utilities for common text and developer tasks. Everything runs client-side. No server-side processing, no data collection, no accounts.

Free tools (13): Word Counter, Password Generator, Case Converter, Find & Replace, URL Encoder, Base64, HTML Entities, Hash Generator, Lorem Ipsum, QR Code Generator, UUID Generator, Unix Timestamp Converter, Word Frequency Counter.

Premium at $4.99/mo (11): JSON Formatter, Regex Tester, CSV to JSON, SQL Formatter, Color Converter, Markdown Preview, Text Diff, JWT Decoder, Cron Expression Generator, JSON-YAML Converter, Code Minifier.

The free tier is fully functional. The premium tier covers tools that developers use most frequently in their daily workflow.

Happy to discuss the technical implementation or anything else.

## STEP 12: POST ON LINKEDIN
Copy-paste this as a LinkedIn post:

I've been working on something I want to share.

As a developer, I use small online tools dozens of times a day. Encode some Base64. Format a JSON blob. Test a regex. Convert a timestamp. Generate a UUID.

The problem: I was pasting data — sometimes sensitive data — into random websites with no visibility into where it goes.

So I built TextTools Pro: 24 text and developer utility tools that run entirely in the browser. Client-side only. No data ever leaves your machine. No account required.

13 tools are completely free. 11 more developer-focused tools are available for $4.99/month.

If you work with text, code, or data regularly, I'd appreciate you taking a look:
